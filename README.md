# Hamster Wheel Hall Effect Sensor

POC of a simple solution based on Rasberry PI with a Hall Effect Sensor to retrive metric from wheel trips 

* Local Network Server with simple API SET
* Local DB 
* Hall Effect Sensor data input
* Android APP to read data

## General info

The doc should provide all information needed to run the project, but if not feel free to add a issue in github and I'll address any questions! :)

### POC

Project is based on Rasberry PI board and AZ-Delivery KY-024

Wheel size is 29CM, you have to know your wheel size, retrive some minor metric and IP to run it

## How to run

### To run the backend:

```bash
  sudo python3 ~/pistacchio.py
```

Requirements:

```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
  pip install tinydb
  pip install gpiozero
```

Check requirements:

```bash
  python3 -c "import tinydb, gpiozero; print('OK')"
```

### To run the Android APP:

Import it in Android Studio and run it

Before start it, please be sure to address the right IP in the Constants.kt

```kotlin
  object GetAPI {
        const val URL: String = "http://192.168.1.99:8000//"
    }
```
